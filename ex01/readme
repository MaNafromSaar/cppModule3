If derived classes come in, "private" must be changed to "protected" 
to allow for this

Construction order:

Base class (ClapTrap) constructs first
Derived class (ScavTrap) constructs second
This ensures the base class is fully initialized before the derived class builds upon it

Destruction order:

Derived class (ScavTrap) destructs first
Base class (ClapTrap) destructs second
This is reverse order of construction (Last-In-First-Out)

Why this order matters:

The derived class might depend on base class members
Base class needs to exist before derived class can use its members
Derived class should clean up its own resources before base class resources are destroyed
This prevents accessing already destroyed base class members during derived class destruction
