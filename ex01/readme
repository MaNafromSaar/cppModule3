# C++, Inheritance, Construction and Destruction Order

## Overview
When derived classes come into play, "private" must be changed to "protected" to allow for inheritance.

## Construction Order
- **Base Class (ClapTrap)**: Constructs first.
- **Derived Class (ScavTrap)**: Constructs second.

This ensures the base class is fully initialized before the derived class builds upon it.

## Destruction Order
- **Derived Class (ScavTrap)**: Destructs first.
- **Base Class (ClapTrap)**: Destructs second.

This is the reverse order of construction (Last-In-First-Out).

## Why This Order Matters
- The derived class might depend on base class members.
- The base class needs to exist before the derived class can use its members.
- The derived class should clean up its own resources before base class resources are destroyed.
- This prevents accessing already destroyed base class members during derived class destruction.
